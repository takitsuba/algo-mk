    "2.6.3 Auction Theory\n",
    "As we discussed in Chapter 1, the algorithmic approach facilitates the development of marketing services that can be offered to clients by ex- changes. An exchange or any other type of broker in between a service provider and service client adds an extra layer of complexity because both the provider and client should optimize their service buying and selling strategies, in addition to pursuit of the primary marketing ob- jectives.\n",
    "The basic goal of a service exchange is to enable competition be- tween buyers for a limited resource, such as advertisement placements. The standard approach to this problem is an auction where each buyer places a bid and the resource is auctioned off to the bidder with the maximum bid. However, auction settings and rules can be set up dif- ferently, so we need to spend some time discussing auction types.\n",
    "First, we have to acknowledge that the bidders participate in the auction because the auctioned resource has a certain value for each of them and they are aiming to make profits by buying the item below this valuation. Consequently, it is critically important for a bidder to estimate the value of the item correctly, and we can classify all auction settings by the following valuation types:"

    "common value This is a particular case of an interdependent value auction where the actual value is the same for all bidders. Exam- ples of common value auctions include selling natural resources such as oil or timber, selling financial assets such as bonds, or sell- ing a company. In all of these cases, the true value might not be precisely known at the auction time and bidders must estimate it based on the limited information that they have, but eventu- ally the value becomes known (actual amount of recoverable oil, long-term company performance, etc.) and it is the same for all participants."
