    "2.6.3 Auction Theory\n",
    "As we discussed in Chapter 1, the algorithmic approach facilitates the development of marketing services that can be offered to clients by ex- changes. An exchange or any other type of broker in between a service provider and service client adds an extra layer of complexity because both the provider and client should optimize their service buying and selling strategies, in addition to pursuit of the primary marketing ob- jectives.\n",
    "The basic goal of a service exchange is to enable competition be- tween buyers for a limited resource, such as advertisement placements. The standard approach to this problem is an auction where each buyer places a bid and the resource is auctioned off to the bidder with the maximum bid. However, auction settings and rules can be set up dif- ferently, so we need to spend some time discussing auction types.\n",
    "First, we have to acknowledge that the bidders participate in the auction because the auctioned resource has a certain value for each of them and they are aiming to make profits by buying the item below this valuation. Consequently, it is critically important for a bidder to estimate the value of the item correctly, and we can classify all auction settings by the following valuation types:\n",
    "private value Each bidder evaluates the item independently from other bidders and the estimate does not depend on other bids, even if they are known.\n",
    "interdependent value The actual value is not known to the bid- ders, and, although each bidder has their own estimate of what\n",
    "the value is, information about other bids can help to improve the estimate. For example, a bidder who highly values the resource might reduce their bid if other participants bid lower, because this additional information can indicate the presence of negative factors that are unknown to the given bidder but are somehow recognized by the others.\n",
    "common value This is a particular case of an interdependent value auction where the actual value is the same for all bidders. Exam- ples of common value auctions include selling natural resources such as oil or timber, selling financial assets such as bonds, or sell- ing a company. In all of these cases, the true value might not be precisely known at the auction time and bidders must estimate it based on the limited information that they have, but eventu- ally the value becomes known (actual amount of recoverable oil, long-term company performance, etc.) and it is the same for all participants."

    "We now study the Vickrey auction in detail to obtain a toolkit for building optimization models that include auctions. We focus on the Vickrey auction because it is convenient for analysis and widely used in practical applications, although similar results can be obtained for other auction types by using more advanced analysis methods.\n",
    "First, we can prove that the optimal strategy for bidders is to bid their true value. Consider Figure 2.14, in which the bidder evaluates the item at a price v but makes a lower bid v   δ. If the second highest bid from another bidder is p, then the following three outcomes are possible:\n",
    "1. p ¡ v: the bidder loses; it does not matter if he bids v or v δ\n",
    "2. p v   δ: the bidder wins and pays price p; it does not matter if\n",
    "he bids v or v   δ\n",
    "3. v δ p v: the bidder loses; a bid of v would have meant\n",
    "winning and making a margin of v   p\n",
    "Figure 2.14: Vickrey auction – bidding below the true value.\n",
    "So, a bid below the true value always gives the same or a worse result as a bid of the true value. Figure 2.15 depicts the opposite situation,\n",
    "            \n",
    "2.6 more specialized models 71 when the bid is above the true value. We again have three possible\n",
    "outcomes:\n",
    "1. p ¡ v δ: the bidder loses; it does not matter if he bids v or v δ\n",
    "2. p v: the bidder wins and pays the price p; it does not matter if he bids v or v   δ\n",
    "3. v p v δ: the bidder wins and pays the price p with a loss of p   v, whereas a bid of v would mean losing the auction without any financial loss\n",
    "Figure 2.15: Vickrey auction – bidding above the true value.\n",
    "We can conclude that bidding the true value is the optimal strategy. This simple result implies that we need to focus on estimation of the expected revenue for the bidder when discussing marketing settings with sealed-bid auctions.\n",
    "              Our next step will be to take the seller’s perspective of the auction and estimate the revenue for the seller. Let us assume that there are n bidders participating in the auction and their bid prices V1 , . . . , Vn are independent and identically distributed random values drawn from some distribution Fpvq with the probability density fpvq. By recalling that k-th order statistic Vpkq of a sample is equal to its k-th smallest value, we can express the expected revenue as the mean of the second- highest order statistic that corresponds to the second-highest bid:\n",

    "Let us consider a slice of the probability density function for the\n",

    "This is the probability that k   1 bids in the sample of n bids are smaller than v, exactly one bid falls into the range rv, v   dvs, and the remain- ing n   k bids are higher than v. These three conditions can be ex- pressed by using the bid cumulative distribution Fpvq and probability\n",

    " pk 1q!pn kq!\n",

    "f  V     n! vk 1p1   vqn k (2.137) pkq pk   1q!pn   kq!\n",
    " This is a beta distribution, so we can use a standard formula for its mean to get the expected revenue of the auctioneer:\n",
    "E  V     n   1 (2.138) pn 1q n   1\n",
    " This result is in alignment with the intuitive expectation that an in- crease in the number of bidders leads to an overall increase in the rev- enue. We use these results in subsequent chapters, mainly to optimize the bidding process for exchanges. It is worth noting, however, that other marketing processes, including such important ones as the selec- tion of the best offers on the market by a consumer, can be modeled as auctions, which makes auction theory an important tool for building programmatic solutions.\n",
    "2.7 summary\n",
    "• Many marketing problems can be expressed as optimization prob- lems in which the business outcome is the subject of optimization and the business actions are the variables.\n",
    "• The dependency between the actions and business outcomes can often be learned from historical data. This problem can be solved by using supervised learning methods.\n",
    "• The primary goal of supervised learning is to estimate the condi- tional distribution of the response given the input. In many practical applications, this problem can be reduced to finding the most proba- ble outcome values. The main two types of supervised problems are classification and regression.\n",
    "• Thenumberofpredictivemodelparameterscanbefixedorcangrow with the size of the training data set. The former type of model is referred to as a parametric model, and the latter is known as a nonparametric model.\n",
    "• Model fitting can be viewed as an optimization problem where the model parameters need to be chosen to maximize the probability that the observed data follows the model distribution.\n",
    "• A wide range of supervised learning problems can be addressed by linear models, that is, models that either express the dependency between the input and output as a linear function or express the boundary between the classes as a straight line. The most basic ex- amples of linear models are linear regression and logistic regression.\n",
    "• Nonlinear dependencies and decision boundaries can be captured by using nonlinear models. Examples of nonlinear modeling meth- ods include kernel methods, decision trees, and neural networks.\n",
    "• Marketing data may have a redundant structure because different features and metrics are projections of the same marketing process. This structure can be nonoptimal for analysis and modeling, and a better data representation can be found by removing correlations, reducing data dimensionality, and clustering data points and enti- ties. Some of these tasks can be solved with unsupervised learning methods, such as principal component analysis and clustering.\n",
    "• Some marketing tasks cannot be easily solved by using standard ma- chine learning methods and require more specialized models and techniques. Examples of such models include consumer choice mod- els, survival analysis methods, and auction theory."
